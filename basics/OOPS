🔷 What is an Interface in Java?

✅ Interface in Java – Key Points (Corrected & Simple)

• Interface is a reference type in Java.

• It does not have method implementation (only abstract methods).

• All methods in an interface are abstract by default.

• We cannot create an object of an interface.

• Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction.

• Interface cannot have a constructor (because no object creation).

• It supports multiple inheritance.

• We use the implements keyword to implement an interface in a class.

• To achieve abstraction in Java, we commonly use interfaces.

• Interface methods are public by default, so the interface itself cannot be private.


⚡ Real-time Example (Company based)

Payment System

interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class GPay implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using GPay");
    }
}

class PhonePe implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using PhonePe");
    }
}

Interface is used for security by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary methods.
It provides abstraction, controlled access, and loose coupling, which makes the system safer and flexible.

🔹 Types of Methods in Java
👉 Mainly two types:
1️⃣ Predefined Method
2️⃣ User-defined Method

And inside user-defined methods, we have:

👉 Static Method
👉 Instance Method

---

✅ 1. Predefined Methods (Built-in)

These are already provided by Java.

📌 Examples:
System.out.println();
Math.sqrt(16);


👉 Created by Java developers
👉 We just use them

---

⚡ Static Method

👉 Belongs to class
👉 No object needed
👉 Called using class name

✔ Example:
class Demo {
    static void display() {
        System.out.println("Static Method");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo.display();   // no object
    }
}

---

👤 Instance Method (Non-static)

👉 Belongs to object
👉 Object is required
👉 Called using object

✔ Example:
class Demo {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Instance Method");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Demo d = new Demo();
        d.show();   // using object
    }
}

🔐 How is Data Hiding done in Java?

👉 By using private access modifier

and

👉 Accessing using public methods (getter & setter)

With Data Hiding (Safe ✅)
class Account {
    private int balance = 10000; // USE private modifier

    public void setBalance(int amount) {
        if(amount > 0) {
            balance = amount;
        }
    }

    public int getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}

Data Hiding is the process of protecting class data by declaring variables as private 
and providing controlled access through public methods(GET AND SET METHODS).
