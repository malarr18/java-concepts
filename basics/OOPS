🔷 What is an Interface in Java?

✅ Interface in Java – Key Points (Corrected & Simple)

• Interface is a reference type in Java.

• It does not have method implementation (only abstract methods).

• All methods in an interface are abstract by default.

• We cannot create an object of an interface.

• Interface is used to achieve 100% abstraction.

• Interface cannot have a constructor (because no object creation).

• It supports multiple inheritance.

• We use the implements keyword to implement an interface in a class.

• To achieve abstraction in Java, we commonly use interfaces.

• Interface methods are public by default, so the interface itself cannot be private.

✔ Interface cannot have object
✔ Interface methods are public by default
✔ A class uses implements keyword
✔ Supports multiple inheritance

⚡ Real-time Example (Company based)

Payment System

interface Payment {
    void pay();
}

class GPay implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using GPay");
    }
}

class PhonePe implements Payment {
    public void pay() {
        System.out.println("Paid using PhonePe");
    }
}

Interface is used for security by hiding implementation details and exposing only necessary methods.
It provides abstraction, controlled access, and loose coupling, which makes the system safer and flexible.
